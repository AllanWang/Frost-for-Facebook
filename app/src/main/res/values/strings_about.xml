    <string name="faq_feature">Can you add feature xxx?</string>
    <string name="faq_feature_desc">I\'m always opened to suggestions,
        and if a feature will enhance your experience, I\'d like to hear it.
        However, please consider taking a look at my
        <a href="https://github.com/AllanWang/Frost-for-Facebook/issues">issue tracker</a></string>

    <string name="faq_cannot_scroll_horizontally">I can\'t scroll horizontally in the webviews.</string>
    <string name="faq_cannot_scroll_horizontally_desc">This is known since the viewpager takes priority for horizontal scrolling.
    Frost has addressed this by allowing horizontal web scrolls if you tap and hold before scrolling.</string>

    <string name="faq_more_frequent_notifications">Can I get more frequent notifications?</string>
    <string name="faq_more_frequent_notifications_desc">I made the decision to prioritize battery life by using a newer job scheduler for Android.
    This means that your framework picks the best time to fetch the notifications, and the lowest window is 15 minutes.
    This is also why I don\'t require the wakelock permission</string>
