* The transparency of open sourced development

Frost is the only third party Facebook app to have:
* Transparent themes and a fully customizable theme engine
* True multiuser support, along with multiuser notifications
* Fully swipable overlays

For testers and users without a play store account, test builds can be found [here](https://github.com/AllanWang/Frost-for-Facebook-APK-Builder/releases).
Note that these builds occur for every commit, including unstable ones.
Typically, those merged into `master` are stable, and those merged into `dev` have been tested.
